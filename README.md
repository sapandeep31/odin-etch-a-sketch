## Introduction

Etch-a-Sketch is a fun project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a canvas-like grid where each square changes color as you hover over it with your cursor. You can reset the entire grid or change its size to fit your preference.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Size:** Change the grid size by specifying the number of squares per side (max 100).
- **Reset Functionality:** Clear all drawn sketches with a single click of the reset button.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Usage

1. **Drawing:** Hover over any square in the grid to draw by changing its color.
2. **Resetting:** Click the "Reset" button to clear all drawn sketches.
3. **Changing Grid Size:** Click the "Change Grid Size" button to enter a new number of squares per side (1-100) for a new grid.
